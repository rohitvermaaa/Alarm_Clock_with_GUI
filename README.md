Sure, here's a sample README.md file for your Python Alarm Clock application:

# Python Alarm Clock

This is a simple Python alarm clock application built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, Pygame for playing alarm sounds, and threading for managing alarm events.

## Features

- Set alarms for specific times.
- Displays current time and date.
- Changes text color to red when the alarm is about to go off.
- Play alarm sound when the alarm time is reached.
- Stop the alarm when it rings.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- Pygame
- Pillow (PIL)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the `alarm_clock.py` file to start the application:

```bash
python alarm_clock.py
```

4. The alarm clock interface will appear on your screen.

5. Set the alarm time by selecting the hours and minutes using the dropdown menus.

6. Click the "Set Alarm" button to set the alarm.

7. If the alarm is set, it will display the time left until the alarm rings. The text color will change to red when the alarm is about to go off.

8. When the alarm time is reached, an alarm sound will play, and a message box will appear. Click "OK" to stop the alarm.

9. To stop the alarm manually, click the "Stop Alarm" button.
